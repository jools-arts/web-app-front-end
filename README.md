# web-app-front-end
Front-end for hobby web application.

The purpose of this web applicaton is to provide paleontolosits with a method of recording, documenting, and sharing their dinosaur fossil discoveries via an online platform thus, making the old method of manually recording dinosaur fossil discoveries by hand totally obselete.

This will afford paleontolosists far more time to concentrate on what they do do best, findng dinosaur remains!

I developed this project so paleontologists would be able to create, read, update, and delete fossil discoveries whilst operating in the field. Thus, increasing the exposure of new discoveries whilst also making the entire process far more efficient.
